# Visual Comparison Notes

Pixelay overlay comparison was performed using design export overlays against the local implementation for both desktop and mobile breakpoints.

## Desktop Comparison

- Overall layout structure, section hierarchy, and content flow align with the Figma design.
- Key UI components such as the hero section, feature sections, pricing blocks, and CTAs visually match the intended design system.
- Colors, gradients, and visual hierarchy are consistent with the design reference.
- Minor visual differences may occur due to normal variations between design tools and browser rendering (font rendering, pixel rounding, and gradient rendering).

## Mobile Comparison

- Layout reflows correctly across mobile breakpoints with sections stacking in the intended order.
- Typography, spacing, and component scaling maintain the visual hierarchy defined in the design.
- Interactive elements such as CTAs remain clearly visible and accessible across smaller screen sizes.
- Minor differences may exist due to responsive scaling and browser rendering behavior.

## Summary

The implementation focuses on maintaining strong visual fidelity, responsive layout behavior, and consistent design system usage based on the provided Figma reference.  
Any minor visual differences are within expected browser rendering variations and do not impact layout structure, usability, or responsiveness.
